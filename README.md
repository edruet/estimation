# Robust estimation

The objective of this repository is to show some basic implementations of estimation methods that can be useful for data processing.
Some basic methods are presented (ordinary least squares, linear regression).
More advanced methods will be presented too.

The idea is to provide examples in scilab, python and C.
The implementations in C will show that it is possible to execute complex processing with a very small amount of code and very few dependencies.
